Players (2)
Materials:
(1) Game Board
(1) Yellow Token
(2) Red Token
(1) Deck of playing cards
(1) Twenty Sided Die

Rules

- Players each have a REd token placed on their seventh Dragon ball

- The Yellow token is placed on the yellow marker in the center of the battle

- Player draw two cards and add up their total (Face cards = 10, Ace = 1, Jokers = 0)

- The player will have three rolls of the die to match the number they have drawn,
  if they reach that number, they will move the Yellow Token over one space (arrow) towards their opponent, completeing the turn.

- If the player fails to reach the number, the token does not advance and the turn is completed.

- The object of the game is for players to move the center token to the end of the arrows to land on their opponant's Character,
  scoring a hit, for each completed round, the player hit must move their Red Token down one Dragon ball and the Yellow Token is reset in the center.

	- KAMEHAMEHA!!!: If a player draws a 1 (a Joker and an Ace) they are given 5 rolls and only win the round if they roll a 1,
	  if the player rolls a 1, they automatically score a hit and the round resets

- The Player who destroys all their opponent's dragon balls is the winner.
