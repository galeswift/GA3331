Royal Warzone
-------------

Pregame:
--------
The game starts with two decks of cards, no jokers.
Each player shuffles their deck and then draws the top five cards.
They may discard those cards to reshuffle and get a new set of cards, one less for each reshuffle.


Gameplay:
---------
There are a total of five turns.
Each turn plays out as follows.
Start:
-Both players may choose to discard a card from their hand face down to the battlefield and draw a new card.  This can be done only once.
-At the beginning of each turn, the losing player from last turn may refill their hand up to a hand of five cards.
-Both players reveal the top card of their deck and put it onto the battlefield face up.

Middle:
-At any time, a player may override the card on their side of the battlefield with a card from their hand.
-The highest value card wins the round.  Aces win over Kings.
-If two cards are the same value, both players put the top three cards from their deck face down onto the battlefield, then flip one to resolve the tie.
-After resolving a tie, all other face down cards on the battlefield are revealed.
-Players can still override cards from their hand to win a tie after the card is revealed.
-Additional ties can be forced.
-A tie can also be forced by putting down a pair of the same value cards from the player's hand at once.  This overrides both sides of the battlefield.

End:
-The winning player takes all cards on the battlefield and puts the non-face cards on the bottom of their deck.
-The winning player takes the top five cards from the opponent's deck and places it on the bottom of their deck.
-All face cards stay out in the royalty zone, making them not on the battlefield.
-Winning a turn with a jack steals an additional five cards.
-Winning a turn with a queen steals an additional ten cards and any jacks in the royalty zone.
-Winning a turn with a king steals an additional fifteen cards and any queens and jacks in the royalty zone.
-Winning a turn with an ace let's the winner choose to switch hands, decks, or both and then take their winnings.


Endgame:
--------
If at any time a player goes to draw and there are no cards to draw from, that player loses.
At the end of the fifth turn, the player with the most cards in the royalty zone steals the opponent's entire deck and therefor wins.
