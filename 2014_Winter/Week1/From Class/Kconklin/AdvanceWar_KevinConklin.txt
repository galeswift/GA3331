Advanced War1:

	Rules:
	- When a player gets all for Aces, the player gets to choose to remove all the Aces from their deck
	(out of play, through the rest of the game) and it gives all the cards in their deck, 1 number boost
	(example: 2 hearts == 3 hearts, 10 hearts == Jack of hearts, king of hearts == Ace of Hearts)
	- When a player gains cards, it goes into a pile

	When in war:
	- the player has the losing card, they can draw another 3 cards, and place another card
	in replacement, with 1 number lower than the original
	- player can give the player 1 card to see the other player(s) hidden cards, or 2 to see 
	your own cards, and has a choice to surrender the same card, in order to keep the 3 hidden cards.

	Win/loss:
  	- If a player has a higher card, the lower card(s) go to the owner of the higher card.
	- If a player runs out of cards, the player loses

	Strategy:
	- Can predict the winning card, if so, player gets the other card of the other player(s) deck, if not
	the other player(s) gets 2 of the losing player's deck
	- Can call in reinforcements anytime(which player calls it, draws another card, the number value is in half
	plus the already playing card) if player that called reinforcements loses, all the cards
	go to the winner of the round (can choose up to 10 cards of reinforcements)

	- Jacks:  11
	- Queens: 12
