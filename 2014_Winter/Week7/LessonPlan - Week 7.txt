Refresher course of two weeks ago
	Lab work exercise 
		Make a trigger that opens a door when you touch it.
		Use triggers, character controllers, and iTween
	Button that triggers a Chest that opens + plays animation
	Managers
		Global variables
			Global variables are accessible from any script
			Show how to make varibles global
				Drop down menu
				Or button on variables screen
			Make two global variables
				Current player health (as int)
				Current player health (as string)
		Create health manager Game object
			Create a setup state
			Create set int value action to initialize player health
			Create a GUIText object to show player health on screen
			Create a convert int to string action
			Add action to set the GUIText to the health string
			Create listener state on health manager
		Create health pickup object
			Add game object (health cross)
			Make the object rotate
			Add a trigger to the health object
			Add a setup state to the trigger FSM
			
			Now we need to notify the health manager.
			Could also just point to the health manager directly
			Instead, we'll register the health manager into a global variable	
			Now let's add a transition for the Health manager.
			Now we are going to send an event to the health manager.
		Let's actually add the health now
		We have to update teh GUI Label again.  
	Lab work - Remove health based on touching a platform

Powerpoint #1
	Designing for different player types (Mass Market, Hardcore, Casual).  
		Abilities of the target market
				Reading ability
				Learning Curve
					Controller
				Common conventions for experienced players may actually confuse newer ones
					Life meters, hit points, subscreens, HUDs
					If you include these, you may have to explain them more
				Cognitive abilities
				Learning Style
				Physical Abilities
				Tactical Desires
		Targeting the mass market gamer instead of a limited demoraphic
			Try to avoid excluding anyone
			Eurogames are a specific example
				Typically played in 20-90 minutes
				Short setup time
				Simple rules, short learning curve
				Cooperative, no confrontational (trading/negotiaion)
				Has strategic decision making along with measured randomness
				Minimal player downtime
		Chance Versus Skill
			Finding the balance
	Lab #1 In class challenge
			FPS for girls
			Using the DR dance pad for five different uses, each for a different market 
				Better if it doesn't involve dancing
			Deer hunter was really popular with wal-mar shopper.  
				The game was intended for wal mart shoppers, now make another.			
			Educational MMO
	Rewards instead of punishments "Framing"
		Hotel registration - discount for early registering, NOT a penatly for late registreing
		WoW exp rested bonus
		Examples of other types of framing?

	Multiplayer games
		How do you define a multiplayer game?
			Quantity-based distinctions
				2 players versus 2000
		What kind of play is involved?
			Real Time
			Turn based
			Competitive
			Cooperative
			Usually games are a mix of these
		Technology based
			MUDs
			MMO
			LAN
			Services like xbox live/steam
		How does it change design?
			You have to consider dynamic scalability.  Players go in and out
			Griefing
			Community formation and support
			Attracting new and old players
			Issues with interfaces
	Gametypes within UDK
		Deathmatch
		Team deathmatch
		Vehicle CTF
		Bombing run


Powerpoint #2
	Rules and constraints
		Additive and subtractive design
			Why Add mechanics?
				Note, this can be very costly
				Ideally, you know about all the mechanics before they enter production, but this doesn't always happen
				Publisher demand (they give you the moneyz)
				Changes in the marketplace
				The game sucks
				You're making a sequel
				The brainstorm
			Why remove mechanics?
				This can be VERY costly as well
				Publishing
				Marketing conditions
				Fixing bad gameplay
				Ratings
				Delivering on or in better tim
				Checking features against the core checklist
			Lab - Challenge - Mix a mechanic from an existing board game with another game

Using mouse pick for the physics pop
	Reminderof physics pop
	
	
Mouse pick move an object to a location
	* Make a target first (A sphere)
	Create a go_Clickmanager
		* State Waiting on Click
			* Mouse Button Down action
			* Clicked Event
		* Check if hit something state
			* Mous epick action
			* Make variable -> Did I Click an Object
			* Make variable -> Where did I click
			* Bool test action
				* Make event -> Hit Object
				* Make event -> Didn't hit object
		* Set position action
		* Notice you can click the object still moves.  Need to tag it
		
LAB: Spawn particle when you click on a spot
	
	Create a single cube
	Add a rigid body component
	Move the cube into the air to make sure it falls
		
	Create a go_Clickmanager
		* State Waiting on Click
			* Mouse Button Down action
			* Clicked Event
		* Check if hit something state
			* Mous epick action
			* Make variable -> Did I Click an Object
			* Make variable -> What did I click
			* Bool test action
				* Make event -> Hit Object
				* Make event -> Didn't hit object
		* Hit Object state
			* Add force action
			* Add finished transition

Lab work - Spawn a particle where you clicked


Projectiles (Shooting gallery) - First person shooter 
	We aren't using the click manager, so disable it 
	Make a bullet
		Assign a color sheet
		object that moves forward in z
		Physics based (Adding force)
		Make it explode on touch by adding a trigger
		Add a particle system
		Make a prefab from this
	Let's make the gun
		Crosshairs on screen (GUI Texture) - or can lock the cursor using the Set Mouse action (Do this on the first person controller)
		Hide the mouse
		Hooking up click event 
			* Do this on a new object that's a weapon, parented to the camera
			* Reset the weapon position
			* Make Idle-Firing-Cooldown states.  
			* Clicked event
			* Idle state -> Get Mouse Button Down action
			* Firing State -> Create Object action
				* Move the gun so it's a little bit forward of the player
			
		Spawn object from spawn point (in front of the camera)
		Setting the rotation
	Let's make a target that can die
		Simple cube
		Apply red material to it
		Attach a trigger
		Add a state for listneing
			Trigger event
			Trigger on enter, with bullet tag
			( Make the bullet tag)	
		Make "Hit by Bullet" event
		Add a destroy target state
			Add a destroy object action
		Tag the bullet prefab now (Make sure to tag the trigger too)
		Destroy the object and spawn a particle
	Lab work - Make your own gun (Shotgun, machine gun, grenade launcher)
	

Homework - Game prototype : Explosion
	
For next time:
	Enemies (top down arena)
		Lab work
