Introduction to Unity
	Scene View - where you edit
	Heirarchy - all objects in the scene in alphabetical order (including parenting, a way of grouping objects)
	Game view - When you press play, this becomes active
	Project - All assets that belong to your project
	Inspector - context sensitive panel, show properties of whatever object/asset/panel you've selected
	Play/controls - play/pause/advance
	Manipulators - move/rotate/scale, local/world space, center/pivot point based rotation
	Layers dropdown - useful for showing/hiding content. 
	layout dropdowns - adjusting interface overview
	
Scene view
	Q/W/E/R
	Left mouse = move
	Right mouse = rotate
	ALT + Left mouse = orbit
	ALT + rigt mouse = zoom
	right mouse + WASD = move like FPS
	F = focus on object
	Searching/filtering
	gizmo editing
	view gizmo (ortho/perspective)
	CTRL + D = duplicate
	
Game view
	Can be paused/stepped forward
	You can tweak values while in play mode.  This is temporary if you're trying to edit game objects (not assets)
	Setting resolution specific to target platform
		Change in file->Build settings
		Edit->Project Settings->Player
	Maximize on play
	Editing color in play mode
Heirarchy
	A-z order
	Heirachys represent groups, topmost object is a parent, while the rest are children
		They transform together
	Parent transforms
		Translation is now based on the parent
		Moving/scaling
	Add Object menu
	Search
		Behaves like the other search
		T: (lets you search for types), ie: T:Light
		Bottom of heirarchy shows path to the object found
Project panel
	Any assets you create or import will be placed here
		Importing (import through menu or add to the folder)
	If you want to move files around, use the project panel, not explorer
	One/Two column view
	Reorder
	label
	preview assets (Slider at bottom)
	You can filter and Sort/search - by name/type/label or by favorite groupings
		Star button will 'favorite' a group or search
	You can search the asset store too, but changing the search typ efrom "Asset" to "Asset Store"
Inspector
	Static checkbox
	tag/layer dropdowns
	Component list (ie: transform)
		Click and drag values
		Click/retype values
		You can reset the value using the 'cog' icon
		Documentation viewable with the blue book
	Inspector changes to whatever you have selected
	You can lock the inspector if clicking objects would change context
		ie: For setting textures
	Finding references by clicking the textures/material previews
	You can disable components with the checbkox
	Checkbox at the top of the object can disable the entire object

Game objects
		In the scene
		made up of components
		typically a transform component
		Can add components with button or menu
		Scripts are also considered components
		You can remove/copy+paste components
		You can drag+drop things from the project view into almost anywhere
		
Tags
	Tagging multiple game objects together, ie: "Enemy"
	Used in scripts, to find game objects.  GameObject.FindWithTag("");, or FindGameObjectsWithTag

Prefabs
	Can be placed or spawned in game
	To make, make a game object first into your scene, with any components you need
	Then drag it to the project panel to create it as a prefab
	then you can delete it from the scene
		You can edit changes using the "Apply" button if you want to place the object first

Buildling your games


Lab work for Unity + Playmaker
	Introduction to states
		What is a state?
			Super common.. you probably didn't know it
			A really convenient way to track the conditions and behaviors of an object at any time
		State machine
			A bunch of these states connected together with events to form a system
		Real world example
			Light switch
				What states are there
				What events take you from one state to another
				Can't turn a light switch that's on, already on
			Doors
		Add new FSM
			Explain start box, first thing that happens for this object
				Maybe on a monster this is what happens first
			Explain State 1 (First state)
			We're going to need two states (off/on)
				Can move wherever you want
			Can relabel states
		Creating events
		Creating transitions
		Creating links between transitions and states
		Action browser 
			GUI Buttons On/Off butons
		Press Play and show real-time state debugging
		Show how to modify intensity of the light
		Action to set the light intensity

		Lab exercises after each one
1. Light switch
2. Open/close states
	Treasure chest
3. Triggers
	Changing text 
4. Variables
5. Clicking to change color of cube - using fsm
6. Buliding third person controller
