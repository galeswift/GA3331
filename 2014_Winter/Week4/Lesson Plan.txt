"Opened door".  I like to use past tense.	What is a transition? - Transitions visually show how states change from one to another.  Transitions are activated by events which change the state		- You can add multiple transitions to a single state 		How are events and transitions connected?  Right click menu pulls from the event menu	Review light switch		Set start state to change the stateLab - Add two buttons	Each one plays a different soundKeyboard input handling	Adding a single soundLab -  Keyboard input Adding multiple sounds	Adding multiple transitions to a single stateReview of Triggers	What are triggers	How are they used in games	Lab work - Make a trigger that shows a button while your inside	Lab work - Make the button play a soundReview of third person controller	Adjusting speed so you can run	Rotate towards behavior	Attaching the camera - decoupling it (zelda/top down camera)	Chest open/close - Animations	- Open state	- The "finished" event	- Close state	- Intermediate state	- Adding audio when opening	- Making a 'prize'	- Making particlesReview prefabsReview Variables	You've been using them already	Think of a bucket		You can put something in it		You can fill it up		You can look inside of it		You can take things back out of it		Apple inside bucket, put, fill, look, take	Whatever is inside of a variable is called a value		Bucket = Variable		Apple = ValueHow to display 'time' in your game	- GUI Labels	- Converting numbers	- Formatting strings	- String Format {0:0.##}	- GUI Skins/fonts/colorRestarting the levelOpening a chest	- Making it so you have to stand in front of the chestFirst person view	Import character controller unity package, drag + drop the controller into the sceneBreakable objects	Examples of breakables in games		Zelda		Castlevania	Import asset package for Playmaker	Place unbroken vase	Place broken vase at the same location	Place trigger	Create states in trigger		Unbroken			-> Broken event		Exploding			-> Finished event		Broken	Now we have to handle visibility on the vase mesh		Set visibility action - On the mesh itself, not the object		Add new 'setup' state to toggle visibility on broken mesh so it's hidden		Set this as the new start state		Explain start states	Demonstrate copy-pasting actions	Hook up the trigger action so it breaks the object	Particle systems		-> Detour on making your own particle systms		-> Use the "Create Object" action	Parent all the objects to the unbroken vase	Create coin object		Set texture		Add rotating behavior (rotate action)		Add particle system to the coin		Add trigger to destroy the coin and "collect" it	Explain parent objects so that the particle and trigger are parented	Explain GetParent() object 		Used to destroy the parent object when picked up when the coin is created as a prefab	Now make the coin prefab	Now create teh coin prefab when the vase is destroyed		Have to use GetParent again to choose the spawn point	Now - Lab work with this lesson - 		Platform color changes	Apply material to platform object	Make trigger	Create setup state	Create trigger listener state	Create two color variables	In setup state		Set Color Value on both variables to initialize their color	Add another variable for Current Color (as int)	Add Set Int Value action		Set initial value to 1 or 2 (whichever want you want to start as)	Add color checker state -> From listener state		Add Int Switch action (2 int switches)	Add two new states and two new actions 		Set Red + event		Set Green + event	On the Set Red/Green states		Add a Set Material Value action		Add a Set Int action to change the color value	Finished transition on eachitween objects	First show how to move objects first without iTween	Explain iTween move		Explain each field	Show other iTween actions		iTween shake -
