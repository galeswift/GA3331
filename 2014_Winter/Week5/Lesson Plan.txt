On the mesh itself, not the object		Add new 'setup' state to toggle visibility on broken mesh so it's hidden		Set this as the new start state		Explain start states	Demonstrate copy-pasting actions	Hook up the trigger action so it breaks the object	Particle systems		-> Detour on making your own particle systms		-> Use the "Create Object" action	Parent all the objects to the unbroken vase	Create coin object		Set texture		Add rotating behavior (rotate action)		Add particle system to the coin		Add trigger to destroy the coin and "collect" it	Explain parent objects so that the particle and trigger are parented	Explain GetParent() object 		Used to destroy the parent object when picked up when the coin is created as a prefab	Now make the coin prefab	Now create teh coin prefab when the vase is destroyed		Have to use GetParent again to choose the spawn point	Now - Lab work with this lesson - 		Implementing a loss condition	Game that involves clicking before time runs outManagers	Global variables		Global variables are accessible from any script		Show how to make varibles global			Drop down menu			Or button on variables screen		Make two global variables			Current player health (as int)			Current player health (as string)		Create health manager Game object		Create a setup state		Create set int value action to initialize player health		Create a GUIText object to show player health on screen		Create a convert int to string action		Add action to set the GUIText to the health string				Create listener state on health manager	Create health pickup object		Add game object (health cross)		Make the object rotate		Add a trigger to the health object		Add a setup state to the trigger FSM				Now we need to notify the health manager.			Could use - "Find Game Object" action		Could also just point to the health manager directly		Instead, we'll register the health manager into a global variable				Use the "Get Owner" action				Add a global variable for health manager (as game object) - Called health manager global				Assign this variable to the get owner action				Now let's add a transition for the Health manager.			Create event called "Add Health"			Add this event to the health manager listener				Now we are going to send an event to the health manager.			Use the "Send Event" action			Event target is "GameObjectFSM"			FSM name is FSM			the event to send will need to be made global.			Go to the "Add Health" event on the health manager and make it global						Set the trigger event to call update health						Add a destroy Object action	Let's actually add the health now		Add a new state to the health manager "Add Health"		Add an "int Add" action, add 25 to the current player health.			We have to update teh GUI Label again.  		Instead of duplicating the action, describe how to share states now		Move the Convert + Set GUI Text actions into their own state		Hook up the events correctly now		Lab work - Remove health based on touching a platform	Platform that removes health	Basically the opposite of the health pickup					Now we need to limit the health before we add it.		Use the "Int Compare" actoin		Add a "Do Nothing" event		If you're already at 100 or higher, do nothing.		Next we need to check health that lets you know when you've died		After subtracting health, update teh GUI			Am I dead state to let you know when you died		Do nothing event		Kill_player event			Destroys the playerUsing mouse pick to change the location of an objectPhysics Pop	Add cube	Add physics component(physics -> Rigid Body	Explain physics material	Single object	Add force action	iTween Rotate Add	Multiple cubes	Random	Pop-up manager		Random Float action		Wait action		Get Random Object actionLab work -
